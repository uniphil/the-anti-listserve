So there's this site, [The Listserve](http://thelistserve.com/). It's going about a year now. Awesome.
Except that it kind of sucks. And it's nowhere near on track to 1m subscribers.

It's a shame because it's such a cool idea. I like [this post](http://www.mirverburg.com/why-the-listserve-fails-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-merry-christmas-everyone/)

My problem with the listserve is that they're taking this incredibly cool idea for something on the internet, and
then plugging their ears and pretending they're not on the internet.

The Listserve has been completely __static__. Stagnant. I can't find a single thing that has changed. They apparently
came up with some genius formula before starting, and feel they don't need to ever change it. Which doesn't feel like
the place I call the internet.

My sister recently "won" the lotery and got to send an email, so I got to see their rules. Here they are:

> What can I send? 
> - Text — letters, numbers, symbols 
> - No links, images, HTML, Javascript, etc. 
> - 600 words max
> 
> What can I write? 
> - Anything! Well, almost anything... We reserve the right not to send your message if it threatens the spirit of the list — hate speech, etc. 
> - If you send something overtly controversial, or (self-) promotional, you must provide your name and email information and why you believe in what you are endorsing — you cannot be anonymous.  Spam is unappreciated.
> 
> SUGGESTIONS:
> 
> 1. Remember, you can write literally anything! But... 
> 2. The best e-mails are specific. 
> 3. Don’t sound like a greeting card.  
> 4. Think about the responses you want from The Listserve community. 
> 5. Write a draft. Step away. And come back to it.

Wait, there are ruleS? Yeah. Also kind of anti-internet, but hey, there has to be a line somewhere, so ok. But wait
wait wait!! If there are rules, why aren't they public??? I can't find them anywhere. Right, they're geniuses who
got the formula right before they launched. If their rules are perfect, why post them anywhere public where they
might have to engage with critical discussion of them and actually defend them?

These rules affect everyone who subscribes to The Listserve. __They should be public__.

The rules themselves seem pretty arbitrary.

__No links__: Ok, some sites are harmful. So screen for those. This is _the internet_. Or post a public statement
of the problem of allowing people to share links, and let people give feedback and offer suggestions and solutions.
I can think of a couple. My cynical side wants to say they made this rule because they were worried that people
would just post a hundred links to cat photos. Indeed, a lot of early posters instructed readers to google/search
youtube for things, since they couldn't link. I desparately hope I'm wrong. I would love to recieve that email.

__600 words max__: Why? I, again desperately, hope that there is some technical reason for this restriction, or
something otherwise definsible. As far as I can tell, from authors referencing the rules, this one has been there
from the start, so it doesn't seem to be a response to an issue they encountered or based on any feedback. Maybe
there is a technical barrier that forces them to restrict emails to 600 words (uh...). Again, why don't they
post about it somewhere public. Get feedback and suggestions. Maybe there's a way around it.

But my cynical side comes up again. Maybe their genius vision was for one _digestible_ email each day for everyone
from a random winner. They have some kind of ideal message in mind, and want to steer people into that box.

Well, I don't want emails written from random people who are plunked into boxes first. I want it raw. If someone
decides to post their whole thousand-page novel, then clip it at 1000 words and link to the rest. But why would
you stop them???

__No spam__: Why? Give people some credit. And if someone wants to use their lottery winnings on spamming a million
people, who are you to stop them?

__No anonymity for controversial/promotional stuff__: Why??? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ? ? ?

_almost anything_ ... _literally anything_ ... um.

It also really bothers me that the people who are selected are refered to as winners. But that might just be me.

I want a The Listserve that tries to be invisible between me and whoever is sending the message. I want a The
Listserve that's not afraid to admit it is a thing on the internet.
